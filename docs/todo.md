Leaves don't need to know how much money they have because their parent stem knows.
We need to be able to randomly choose someone weighted by their balance.
We need a totally ram version of the trie and the ability to use the ram trie to update our hard drive trie efficiently. This is a batch-write.
We should also be able to read a RAM trie out of the hard drive given a root and list of leaves.
